A VPS (Virtual Private Server) is a VM (virtual machine) which is typically hosted in a cloud datacentre somewhere. Popular providers include [Linode](https://www.linode.com/lp/podcasts/?ifso=ssh), DigitalOcean, AWS, and so on.

We are looking to create only a handful of services and most of these providers minimal VPS configurations will suffice for our requirements.

For example the $5 per month offerings from both Linode and DigitalOcean will be adequate.

## A dilemma

Is it really self-hosting running your services on someones elses cloud computer? I say yes, because I have root to the VM but if you're a little more security or privacy focused then maybe an on-premise solution like a [[Raspberry Pi]] might suit you a little better.
