# Hosting

If this is your first time self-hosting a service, welcome. This might seem a little intimidating but it's not *so* bad.

## Where to host?

You have a few options to self-host these services. You could use a [[VPS]], a [[Raspberry Pi]] or any other [[Linux server]] (note I've deliberately left this link incomplete so you can see how this is handled by mkdocs) of your choosing.

## DNS

This guide assumes:

-   You own your own domain such as "perfectmediaserver.com", purchasing a .com domain costs as little as $10 per year
-   You have a Cloudflare account to use as your DNS provider (this is free)

I've written previously about how to configure DNS for [perfectmediaserver.com](https://perfectmediaserver.com/remote-access/traefik101.html#domain-setup-namecheap).
